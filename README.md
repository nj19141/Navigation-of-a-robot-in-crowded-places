# Navigation-of-a-robot-in-crowded-places
In the output, yellow represents the path of the robot. Greeen represents the path of humans.
The output may not be very clear because the movement is very precise(1 pixel at a time).
The end point of every path is connected to the origin so that it is easy to figure out the endpoints.
Dynamic output was not possible so after calculating all points, they were plotted together.
